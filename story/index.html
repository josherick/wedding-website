					<div class="story-entry-header lowercase-font">How We Met</div>
					We first met in 2014 while both attending the University of
					Michigan (Go Blue!) after moving into the same floor of a
					learning community (shoutout MCSP). While there were
					initial sparks, Josh ‘had an internship that summer, so he
					couldn’t commit to a relationship right then.’ Bummer.

					<div class="story-entry-header lowercase-font">How We Started Dating</div>
					In 2016, we moved into a group house with friends off
					campus, because that sounded like a great idea with no
					romantic risks whatsoever. A month later, we were dating
					(there were bets placed on how long it would take). Thanks
					to our friends for putting up with how annoying (&amp;
					cute?) we were.

					<div class="story-entry-header lowercase-font">How We Made it Work Long Distance</div>
					After graduation, Josh moved to Seattle for work in 2017.
					Megs visited him on long weekends her senior year, because
					no studying was happening anyway. She graduated a year
					later and moved to Washington, D.C. That made ours a tale
					of two Washingtons and lots of redeye flights. We were long
					distance for two years, until Josh moved to New York in
					2019 (then we were short distance).

					<div class="story-entry-header lowercase-font">How We Survived COVID</div>
					During the pandemic, we temporarily moved in together in
					Ann Arbor (thanks for housing us, parents, and for waiting
					for our return, friends and roommates!). 2020 was horrible,
					but living together wasn’t, especially when we didn’t have
					to commit to joint rent.

					<div class="story-entry-header lowercase-font">How We Finally Moved In Together</div>
					In 2021, Josh moved back to New York and Megs moved back to
					D.C., with the promise of picking a city and (finally)
					moving in together in a year. In 2022, the allure of
					overpaying for everything, subway rats, and a shoebox
					apartment won out, and Megs moved to Brooklyn to live with
					Josh, officially entering our DINK era.

					<div class="story-entry-header lowercase-font">How We Proposed</div>
					Two years and one small black cat later (hi, Ginny), Josh
					proposed to Megs in Domino Park in July 2024. She ordered
					two desserts at dinner, oblivious, as Josh ‘went to the
					bathroom’ five times to text and stall the photographer.
					Megs then proposed to Josh on a hike in Leelanau later that
					summer (Josh was also oblivious, although he shouldn’t have
					been, since Megs doesn’t hike for any other reason). After
					a long, handwritten speech (Megs) and lots of crying
					(Josh), he also said yes!

					<div class="story-entry-header lowercase-font">How We’re Doing Now</div>
					We’re overjoyed to finally get married after what will be
					10 years of dating and 12 years of knowing each other. We
					could not be more grateful for all of our loved ones for
					their support and friendship over the years, and we’re
					ecstatic to have you all join us in Suttons Bay to
					celebrate this next chapter. See you on August 1, 2026!
