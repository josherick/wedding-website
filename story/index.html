					<div class="story-entry-header lowercase-font">How We Met</div>
					We first met in 2014 while both attending the University of
					Michigan (Go Blue!) after moving into the same floor of a
					learning community (shoutout MCSP). While there were
					initial sparks, Josh ‘had an internship that summer, so he
					couldn’t commit to a relationship right then.’ Bummer.

					<div class="story-entry-header lowercase-font">How We Started Dating</div>
					In 2016, we moved into a group house with friends off
					campus, because that sounded like a great idea with no
					romantic risks whatsoever. A month later, we were dating
					(there were bets placed on how long it would take). Thanks
					to our friends for putting up with how annoying (&amp;
					cute?) we were.

					<div class="story-entry-header lowercase-font">How We Made it Work Long Distance</div>
					After graduation, Josh moved to Seattle for work in 2017,
					and Megs visited him on long weekends her senior year,
					because no studying was happening anyway. When she
					graduated a year later, she moved to Washington, D.C.,
					making ours a tale of two Washingtons and lots of redeye
					flights. We were long distance for two years, until Josh
					moved to New York in 2019 (then we were ‘short distance’).
					Both of us were relieved to be in the same time zone, have
					a train between us, and be able to work remotely to extend
					our visits.

					In 2021, Josh moved back to NYC and Megs moved back to
					D.C., with the promise of picking a city and (finally)
					moving in together in a year. In 2022, the allure of
					overpaying for everything, subway rats, and a shoebox
					apartment won out, and Megs moved to Brooklyn to live with
					Josh, officially entering our DINK era.

					<div class="story-entry-header lowercase-font">How We Proposed</div>
					After two years of living in sin, Josh proposed to Megs in
					Domino Park in July 2024. She ordered two desserts at
					dinner, oblivious, as Josh ‘went to the bathroom’ five
					times to text and stall the photographer. After Megs said
					yes, we celebrated at the same bar we went to on our first
					night of living in NYC. Megs then proposed to Josh on a
					private hike in the Leelanau Peninsula later that summer
					(Josh was also oblivious, although he shouldn’t have been,
					since Megs doesn’t hike for any other reason). After a
					long, handwritten speech and lots of crying on both sides,
					Josh also said yes!

					<div class="story-entry-header lowercase-font">How We’re Doing Now</div>
					We’re overjoyed to finally get married after what will be
					10 years of dating and 12 years of knowing each other. We
					could not be more grateful for all of our loved ones for
					their support and friendship over the years, and we’re
					ecstatic to have you all join us in Suttons Bay to
					celebrate this next chapter. <br /><br />

					While we’re still living in (and overpaying) for Brooklyn,
					constantly traveling, or chasing our pet cat Ginny around,
					we always come back to Michigan. The Midwest will always
					feel most like home, and ‘Up North’ has always been a
					special place for us to relax, slow down, and spend quality
					time together. It was a no brainer that we’d get married
					there, and we hope you see why during our wedding weekend.
					See you on August 1, 2026!
